    Welcome to the Rice Plant Disease Classification System! üåøüîç
    
    The mission is to help in identifying rice plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image then the system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Classification** page and upload an image of a rice plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** The system will process the image using VGG16 model to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results of the disease.

    ### About
    - **Accuracy:** The system utilizes transfer learning techniques for accurate disease classification.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Classification** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience for Rice Plant Disease Classification System!

    The trained dataset can be found on the link [Kaggle Rice Crop Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thegoanpanda/rice-crop-diseases). 
    This dataset contains 200 images of disease-infected rice plants. The images are grouped into 4 classes based on the type of disease. There are 50 images in each class.
    - Bacterial Leaf Blight Disease
    - Blast Disease
    - Brown Spot Disease
